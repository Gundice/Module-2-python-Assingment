## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas` for Python and `install.packages("readr")` for R.
3. Run the Python script `process_data.py` to process the salary data.
4. Run the R script to extract the zipped file for employee details and view its content

## Files
